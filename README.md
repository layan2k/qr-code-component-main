### What I learned

I learned about positioning using flexbox.

- Flexbox can be used to position elements along the main axis (the direction set by `flex-direction`) or the cross axis (the direction perpendicular to the main axis).
- The main axis is typically the horizontal axis, but it can be the vertical axis if `flex-direction` is set to `column`.
- The cross axis is typically the vertical axis, but it can be the horizontal axis if `flex-direction` is set to `column`.
- The following properties can be used to control positioning in flexbox:
  - `justify-content`: Controls the alignment of items along the main axis.
  - `align-items`: Controls the alignment of items along the cross axis.
  - `align-content`: Controls the alignment of the flex items' main axes.
